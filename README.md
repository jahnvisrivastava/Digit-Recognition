# Digit-Recognition

A Handwritten Digits Recognition project using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) involves building a system that can accurately classify handwritten digits (0-9) from images. This project demonstrates how deep learning techniques can be applied to image classification problems.

Handwritten Digits Recognition (Using CNN) Project Overview

# Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to automatically recognize handwritten digits from images. The most commonly used dataset for this task is the MNIST dataset, which contains thousands of grayscale images of handwritten digits.

#  Dataset

MNIST Dataset: This is the most widely used dataset for digit recognition. It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits. Each image is grayscale, sized at 28x28 pixels, and labeled with a digit between 0 and 9.

#  CNN Architecture for Digit Recognition

A CNN consists of multiple layers designed to automatically extract important features from images. A typical CNN model for digit recognition may include

# Model Summary

The typical CNN architecture for digit recognition may look like this:

Conv2D (32 filters, 3x3 kernel) → ReLU → Max Pooling (2x2)
Conv2D (64 filters, 3x3 kernel) → ReLU → Max Pooling (2x2)
Conv2D (64 filters, 3x3 kernel) → ReLU
Flatten Layer → Fully Connected Layer (128 neurons) → Output Layer (10 neurons with Softmax)
