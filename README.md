# Digit-Recognition

A Handwritten Digits Recognition project using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) involves building a system that can accurately classify handwritten digits (0-9) from images. This project demonstrates how deep learning techniques can be applied to image classification problems.

Handwritten Digits Recognition (Using CNN) Project Overview

**Objective**:

The objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to automatically recognize handwritten digits from images. The most commonly used dataset for this task is the MNIST dataset, which contains thousands of grayscale images of handwritten digits.
